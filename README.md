Materialgirl
============

This WordPress theme or frontend is developed via these frameworks:

- Materializecss
- _S

## Log

- [Create a theme on _S](http://underscores.me) and install the theme in WordPress.
- Download Materializecss dependencies via Bower (`bower install materialize --save`)
- Prepare the Materialize grid (the development started in `single.php` and the connected template parts)
- Tweak pages, posts, index, custom pages, etc.


## Status

Google's Materializecss i popular among developers right now. It's an alternative to Bootstrap and Friends. 

Now this theme is an experiment: can you create a WordPress theme based on the Materializecss framework?

## Sass

- Compile the _S and Materialize styles to *one* file.
- Automate and test via Gulp (coming soon).
